# TheMoarYouBe
This project was born in Hackathon SmartCities http://www.global.datafest.net/

TheMoarYouBe is a massive open online course (MOOC) intended as a non profit platform. Our goal is provides the best digital experience between the students and teachers because our focus is online collaboration and teamwork.

It's for individuals who want to quickly build sleek tutorials â€” for example, a teacher who builds an assignment for his students, or a musician who builds a short course on music theory and posts it on his or her blog. Or organizations looking to start experimenting with online courses without having to install anything.

#### Our Challenges:
* Be a solid reference in online education.
* Create a platform easy to use for students and teachers.
* Split large learning routes into small parts - for example, 
the learning route: "The Rails Ninja" will be divided into HTML, CSS, and Ruby courses.

### Future features:
* Forum or discussion functionality. 
* Real time assessment.
* Build learning routes with existing small courses created by users.
* Achievements system.
